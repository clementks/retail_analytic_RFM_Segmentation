Predictive DecisionTree Classifier based on Customer RFM Segment_Presentation

Dataset:
Typical sales transactions from retail e-commerce store used to determine the customer purchasing behaviour before making RFM (Recency, Frequency & Monetary) analysis


Objective of this presentation using DecisionTree Classifier:

⏉    Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value (RFM) helps inform customer segmentation in clusters and 
      identifies probability to churn for each cluster. 

⏉     Then could devise a targeted marketing campaign and incentivize these customers to extend their 
       contract and continue to procure products or services to ensure customer retention instead of 
       high cost of acquiring new customer. 

⏉    Based on customer’s purchase history enables the establishment of churn thresholds for each 
      customer group and assists in constructing a model to predict future churners. 

⏉   Make proactive decision to improve customer retention after understanding the propensity of 
    customers to churn. 

Model Evaluation Techniques:

     To measure model optimization we used the f1 score. It provides a better measure of incorrectly 
    classified cases while accuracy only measures cases that are correctly identified. In addition, the f1 
    score is a better metric for an imbalanced class like the one observed in our dataset
